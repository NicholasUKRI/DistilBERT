# DistilBERT Thematic Search Tool

## Introduction
Given a theme described by a set of terms, and a corpus of documents i.e. GTR, we can create a measure of similarity (pseudo-distance) from each document to the theme, and then sort the corpus from most to least relevant.

The user can then choose a threshold that fits their purpose (a balance of false positives and false negatives).
